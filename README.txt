Welcome and thank you for purchasing SilkWood Spring. We've added many new item to keep you and your Elder busy. With chickens, butterflies and plants now independently growing in SilkWood, the mission of finding a home for the Six Elders has never been more fun. We've even added new tasks that you can use in your quest.
SilkWood centers around the daily activities of Elder No.6 shortly after he descended from the Glass City. Your job is to guide Elder No.6 as he tries to build a habitat for the remaining Elders. You will have complete control of his 24-hour schedule. It's your job to schedule his time wisely or suffer the consequences of hunger,diseases or other detrimental effects. If you're lucky you might also uncover what really happened in the Legend of the Burning Tree.

Have Fun. The Elder is in your hand.

Regards
Dexter "DFX" Kofa
Lead Developer of SilkWood.
